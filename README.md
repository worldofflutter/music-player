# Flutter Music Player
On dribble i saw this design and i like it very much. And i saw already on medium someone build it. As a reference, i use his article.
[Meduim Flutter Challenge UI: Music Player App](https://medium.com/nusanet/flutter-challenge-ui-music-player-app-b82d7b41c3bd)

Note that i made some change. I mean, i design this app in my way. So both of our app and code doesn't match.
